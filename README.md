# Mind-Framework

### **What Is the Mind Framework?**

I am developing a **new personality model** superior to the MBTI that can accurately describe people’s personality types/brain patterns. In addition, I'm pioneering a new approach to predict these types based on body language in addition to a traditional written test.

The long-term goal is to create an **AI-powered agent** that determines personality types using a **multimodal approach**, including:

* **Written responses** (word choice, sentence structure, thought patterns)  
* **Behavioral traits** (body language, level of dominance/ submissiveness, decision making, etc.)  
* **Neurobiological data** (brain scans)

**Disclaimer:** **I’m going to sell most of my investment (maybe before bonding) because I need to pay for my rent.** I can’t guarantee any profits from the token and I have no idea how I will monetize it. I also won’t personally shill the coin after bonding. You should treat buying it as gambling on a meme coin. 

I am launching this project on my own, and the more ambitious aspects will require funding that might be unrealistic. The minimum I will achieve is building out a written test and an AI agent that can predict your personality type based on your responses.

The coin may eventually go to zero once AI automates all intellectual labor, making it easy for others to replicate this work. But until then, I’ll do my best to make the project successful.

### **Roadmap**

1. **Build an official website** – Establish an online presence for the project.  
2. **Create a multiple-choice personality test** – The first version of the test will be simple and accessible.  
3. **Develop an AI-powered agent** – This AI will determine personality types by engaging in conversation and analyzing written responses.  
4. **Test and refine** – Improve accuracy through user feedback and data collection.  
5. **Expand the AI’s capabilities** – If funding allows, enhance the AI’s ability to analyze responses more deeply.  
6. **Launch and integrate** – Make the tool widely accessible and explore potential applications.

### **Idealistic Goals (May Not Be Achieved)**

Note: Realistically I don’t know if I can achieve this because it will be incredibly expensive.

* **Develop a machine learning model** that determines personality types by observing behavioral traits (e.g., body language, voice moderation).

I will be posting more information on the GitHub page/official X account soon.
